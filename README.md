# Tournament-Arc
A text based tournament fighting game I made for class

I made this myself

Download everything then run ui.py

create a custom fighter giving them a name, and allocating points into their Strength, Defense, Speed, and Mental. Then pick that fighter from the "Choose Current Fighter" button, and enter them into an 8 person tournament. 

Read how they do, and then spend experience points to improve your fighter. (It's hard as a new fighter to win matches, it may take a few tries before you can level up your fighter)
